# Frontend Quiz App

This project is an experiment to learn more about the useReducer hook in React

If you feel like playing and test your frontend knowledge a live version can be found at the link below:

- [frontend-quiz-app](https://frontend-quiz-hd.vercel.app/)

## installing on your local machine

In order to try the aplication in your own machine you will have to create an account at [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and request an API key.
You can read more about their API here [TMDB API OVERVIEW](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
Follow along the steps below to get a copy at your local machine.

- Navigate to the directory where you want this project to clone and then clone it

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:helciodev/frontend-quiz.git
  ```

- Navigate to the `frontend-quiz` directory

  ```
  cd frontend-quiz
  ```

- Install the npm package running `npm install or yarn`
- Start the server with `npm run dev or yar run dev`
- The site should automatically open in your browser at http://http://localhost:5173/ if it didn't then open your browser with that link.

## Future updates

I am planning to add much more questions about frontend, "not only react"
